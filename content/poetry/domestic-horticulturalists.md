The grass has grown so long,\
It is underfoot no more.\
It is around our ankles,\
Our knees,\
Our eyes.\
A green jungle,\
The blue sky.\
A tiger like kitten\
Prowls the grasslands and prairies of our love.\
A rumbling purr,\
A quiet resentment,\
A long past feeling of order and restraint.\
A painful clarity and of course,\
The hopeless boredom\
Of you\
And me\
And our contempt for gardening.
