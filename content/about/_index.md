title: About me

March 2, 2025

As an opportunistic transmogrifier, recently re-born into anotherâ€™s country,
surrounded and incredulously impressed by the abundance of rejected artifacts,
a source of miraculous mundane wish fulfilment, of mediums used to trace the
connections I make and lose, beings imagined and mythologised, worlds glimpsed
or guessed at.

Beneath the manufactured cluttered waste of the civilisation, the trash, the
treasure of ubiquitous consumption, the silent ones, the spirits of this
place, seek recognition, opportunities to offer regeneration, comfort and
connectedness. Conceptual deities for my reimagined narratives and humble
offerings, distilled from the detritus of my new world, re-presented as images
and occupiers of space within the very dwellings from which the source
materials were discarded.

It is interesting to find memories that are not mine, thrown before my feet,
an invitation by the small gods to pay attention. I want to remember them,
these small gods, though they are not mine. I want them to recognise their
power, and look upon us all with eyes sparked bright by my opportunistic
reverence.
